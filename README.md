# boner-viewer

Don't question my naming sense, this is a WIP Trombone Champ chart previewer

## Features

* Loads and previews `.tmb` JSON files
* Loads and previews base game `.tmb` chart files (NRBF)
* No audio yet, just visual stuff

## TODO

* Audio preview (trombone)
* Audio preview (backing music)
* Change grid snap
* Change zoom
* Some other stuff I'll think about eventually

## Why?

I don't know man

## Notes

This is probably the weirdest way to learn about writing SVGs by hand.
